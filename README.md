There are tools that will be used to achieve the goal of this study, such as:  matplotlib, pandas, seaborn, sklearn for discovering the data and train a model. The work will be done through Jupyter notebook.

TO DO:
â€¢	Explore the data and come up with EDA phases then use a model to fit the data.

# Tools 
- Numpy and Pandas for data manipulation
- Scikit-learn for modeling
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for plotting
